MATH 1350 Introduction to Statistics

I was solely responsible for a section of the class comprising approximately 50 undergraduate students. My responsibilities included teaching, grading, proctoring exams, and holding office hours. This course covered the basics of Statistics, including descriptive statistics, random variables, correlation, linear regression, normal distribution, sampling distributions, confidence intervals, and hypothesis testing.
